# Project Description
We propose the construction of an on-campus microgrid system using redox flow batteries to harness and store the energy obtained from high-efficiency solar cells. The motivation behind this project is to produce a scalable alternative energy system using low-cost, readily available metals that have a lower environmental impact than lithium-ion batteries and lead-acid batteries. For our first prototype, we aim to build a device capable of recharging 5 laptops or cellphones for 24 hours as a demonstration unit for this technology. Our project has a high impact in three broad areas: education, student development and something

UBC something. 

Education: 

Student development: We aim to provide UBC students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with engineering design.

UBC something: The successful construction of this device would further cement UBC's reputation as a leading center of renewable energy research and campus sustainability. 



# Number of team members: 
5 (leads), >20 contributing members

# Student hours needed to complete project: 
1000

# Process for implementing your project:
## Phases 1:
1. Research and prototype: obtain required materials, construct 3D models, develop theoretical model (i.e. if we construct this model what results are we expecting)

## Phase 2: 
2. Test number of different elements independently, characterize their properties and adopt prototype based on results.
3. Use data to construct prototype and test it rigorously.
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until get sastifactory rsults.

## Phase 3:
5. Develop SOP for safe handling
6. Create containment unit for final design that is safe to use and handle

## Phase 4:
7. Obtain feedback from people using it and then reiterate based on feedback.

## Phase 5:
8. If feasible expand grid, write final report for AMS.



# Alignment with broader campus sustainability initiatives:
# Has this project applied for funding in the past? If so, how do you plan on improving your project?
This is a new project and we have not applied for AMS funding or other sources of funding in the past.


#Project Stakeholders
##Which aspects of the university administration will be impacted by your project?
- Showing off clean energy technology that is currently in experimental phase that would raise the reputation of UBC and the department as a center for research excellence in battery tech

##Have you contacted corresponding campus units?
- Yes, Marlene. Support this project, just need to give them safety docs, CHBE giving lab space

##Are you working with a department, staff unit or community organization?
- Yes, CHBE department and CHBE faculty.

##How will your project involve students?
- Being run by a student design team, everyone is welcomed to join, play a role regardless of their educational background

#Please Describe How Your Project Meets the Following 5 Evaluation Criteria
##Reduction of Ecological Footprint:
1. Currently, ESW uses a lead acid battery for their pancake breakfast event which is a toxic metal that has a massive impact on the environment. Our batteries are not and would reduce impact of their event. Based on the scalabiltiy of this project we can in the future grow this system to create an energy grid based on solar power and reduce UBC's reliance on C emitting fossil fuels

##Increased Student Engagement: 
1. Involves a large team of undergraduate students building a battery that would directly reduce eco footprint. Train people develop skillsets, and develop the technology that would increase engagement with the sustainable energy tech.

##Education and Outreach:
1. Our cells can be used to demonstrate the reliability of this sort of technology. During Engineering Open House can be used to charge a phone. Show the latest advancements in battery tech


##Longevity and Feasibility: 
1. Theoretically battery lasts 10 years, materials relatively inexpensive and easy to dispose of in a sustainable manner.
2. We have a machine shop and lab and materials and people with the necessary skillsets. In addition we can seek advice from faculty doing related research


Use this first and second paragraph to describe how much money you are requesting from the Sustainability Projects Fund, what your project aims to do, and also include a very brief sketch of how it could meet our program goals. Aim to convince us that your project is worth considering.

The third and fourth paragraph should persuade us that you and the team you have assembled are the right people for the job and that you are able to carry the project through in a reasonable time frame. 

##Impact at UBC: 
1. Reduce carbon emissions
2. Improving reputation
3. Advancing tech at UBC, showcasing clean alternative energy tech. Helping cement UBC's reputation at the forefront of clean energy tech
4.
